# IGNNV (Information-Guided Neural Network Verifier) (in development)
This MATLAB tool (in development) provides reachability-analysis-based verification for neural networks. The verification process is under the guidance of available information, e.g., specifications, simulations, etc, in order to enhance scalability. 
# Related tools and software
The model-based reachability analysis for plants is based on The COntinuous Reachability Analyzer ([CORA] https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/)
# Installation:
  1) Install MATLAB.
  2) Clone or download IGNNV from (https://github.com/xiangweiming/ignnv).
  3) Run examples.
# Features
  1) This tool use specification-guided method to significantly enhance the scalability in safety verification. 
  
  2) This tool can do backward computation guided by specification for falsification.
  
  3) This tool use simulation-guided method to significantly enhance the scalability in reachable set computation.
  
  4) This tool can compute the reachable set of learning-enabled control systems.
