% Simulink models used for training and testing

1. The "mpcACCsystem.slx" is the simulink model used to train the neural network controller.

2. The "nncACCsystem.slx" is the simulink model where the mpc controller is replaced by the trained neural network controller.

3. The "test_mpcACCsystem.slx" and "test_nccACCsystem.slx" are used to generate the performance comparison of the original mpc controller and the trained neural network controller.


% Run the scripts


1. To train the neural network controller, run script  "nnTrainController.m"

2. Generate simulink block for the neural network controller with following command: "gensim(mrac_net)"

3. Relpace the neural network controller block in "test_nccACCsystem.slx" with the new generated neural network controller block 

4. To compare the neural network controller and the original mpc controller, run "controller_comparison.m".

****Note****: The script "generateOnetrace.m" is called from "nnTrainController.m" to generate data for training.
